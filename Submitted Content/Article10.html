        <h2>Millipede Mania</h2>
        <p><strong>Author: </strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhayrise-coppin-912b64285/" target="_blank">Jhayrise Coppin — Staff Writer </a></p>
        <p><em>Date: </em> August 25th, 2025</p>

<p>As Barbadians, when December approaches there are holiday staples in most households; Christmas Ham, Sorrel, Rum, Black Cake, Sweetbread etc., but in December 2024 – January 2025's case, a not-so-friendly visit came from a swarm of red millipedes. <em>Trigoniulus corallinus</em>, also known as Rocky Red or Scarlet Millipedes, are invasive arthropods native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and are suspected to have entered the island through imported agricultural products—mainly soil, which is their preferred habitat.</p>

<p>Scarlet Millipedes are nocturnal and most active during wet and cool weather. The issue Barbadians face is that these arthropods are attracted to light, resulting in “home invasions.” Sometimes in the same night, dozens of Scarlet Millipedes make their way into homes, making cleanups troublesome and burdensome—especially for those suffering from entomophobia.</p>

<p>Although Scarlet Millipedes are not venomous and do not bite, they do secrete a combination of chemicals such as hydrogen cyanide, benzoquinones, hydroquinones, and other substances that can irritate human skin. These secretions cause temporary skin discoloration, itching, or a burning sensation. They also emit a foul odor, and it is ill-advised to crush dead millipedes as it spreads the strong smell even further.</p>

<p>Barbados's wet season usually occurs from June to November, coinciding with hurricane and tropical storm season. Climate change is altering established weather patterns—making dry seasons drier and wet seasons wetter. Increased rainfall during their reproduction period allowed Scarlet Millipedes to rapidly reproduce before incubating, leading to exaggerated numbers hatching and descending in droves on Barbadian homes.</p>

<p>The red arthropods' ecological purpose is breaking down organic material (fruits, plants, etc.), so traditionally they wouldn’t be viewed as pests. However, their sheer numbers could pose agricultural problems to farmers, as all Scarlet Millipedes have the same nutritional requirements.</p>

<p>In the wild, Scarlet Millipedes can live for a few years, but like most millipedes, they’re unsuitable for dry environments—such as inside a home. Their preferred habitat includes fields, damp logs, soil, or undisturbed areas filled with leaf litter. If left alone after entering a home, they will die on their own within a few days due to moisture level differences.</p>

<p>However, it is unacceptable for most Barbadians to let millipedes occupy their homes for 2–3 days, so many methods of dealing with the invasive species have been applied: pesticides, essential oils, installing mosquito netting on doors and windows, caulking/sealing spaces in doors and windows, glue traps, etc. When using pesticides or insecticides, care should be taken to wear proper protection, carefully follow product labels and instructions. Pet owners should be cautious about pesticide use and the removal of dead millipedes to prevent household pets from ingesting them.</p>

<p>The last swarm took everyone by surprise. Unfortunately, it’s very likely that there will be another invasion in a few months. But with proper preparation and the right precautions, Barbadians should be well equipped to deal with it.</p>
